# 704. Binary Search

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 < nums[i], target < 104
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in ascending order.

```
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + ((right - left) >> 1);
            if (nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else if (nums[mid] > target) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else return mid;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
## Knowledge Points

* inside while loop, which condition we shoud take, I prefer left <= right, because if you use mid +- 1 inside the block that means the bound always change, you don't need to worry about 向下取整导致的死循环. Also this kind of while loop condition will includ the case which only one element in the nums.

* About the overflow things, __DO NOT__ use mid = left + right >> 1, this may also caused overflow. Chonse this way : left + ((right - left) >> 1) 

## Time complexity and space complexity
###
    Time complexity: O(logn) 
    n is length of nums, every time we cut the helf of the nums, so it's log n
### SC :
    O(1) 
    only some constant value here
