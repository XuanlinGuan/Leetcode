# 35. Search Insert Position
Easy

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
-104 <= target <= 104

```
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
    
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + ((right - left) >> 1);
            if (nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else if (nums[mid] > target) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else return mid;
        }
        return left;  
    }
}
```

## Knowledage Points
### Here we talk about why we return left at the end of the code
* when the process exit of the while loop, the right pointer will at the last element who smaller than the target, similar to the right pointer, the left pointer will be at the first element who larger than the target. So we only need to return left when the process jump out of while loop. You may meet this scenario, if we insert the element smaller than the first element in the array whether we should return the right index? Actually no, because when exit the loop, right == -1, left == 0, we should insert the element at index == 0. That's why return left is right.
