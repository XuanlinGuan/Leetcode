142. Linked List Cycle II
Medium

Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Do not modify the linked list.

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
 

Constraints:

The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
 

Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

```
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            if (slow == fast) {// 有环
                ListNode index1 = fast;
                ListNode index2 = head;
                // 两个指针，从头结点和相遇结点，各走一步，直到相遇，相遇点即为环入口
                while (index1 != index2) {
                    index1 = index1.next;
                    index2 = index2.next;
                }
                return index1;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
时间复杂度: O(n)，快慢指针相遇前，指针走的次数小于链表长度，快慢指针相遇后，两个index指针走的次数也小于链表长度，总体为走的次数小于 2n
空间复杂度: O(1)
